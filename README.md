## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Classification Models
| Model              | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **XGBoost**        | High-performance gradient boosting           |
| **SVM**            | Classifies claims as fraudulent or not       |
| **Random Forest Classifier**  | Robust ensemble method             |
| **Logistic Regression** | Baseline binary classifier             |

### Regression Models
| Model                     | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**     | Predicts claim amounts based on linear relationships         |
| **Polynomial Regression** | Captures non-linear trends in claim data                    |
| **Decision Tree Regression** | Tree-based model for predicting claim values             |
| **Random Forest Regression** | Ensemble of decision trees for robust regression         |

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy (for classification)
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score (for regression)

## 🧠 Optimization Techniques

- `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- `Cross-validation` for generalization

---

## 🌐 Deployment

- Built with **Flask**
- Upload claims via web interface
- View fraud predictions and analytics
- Models loaded from `.pkl` files for fast inference

---

## 🔍 Insights

- Fraud often originates from providers (e.g., upcoding)
- Post-payment detection is critical
- Balance between accuracy and speed is essential
